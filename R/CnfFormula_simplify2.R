  #################################
  # Some vocabulary:
  # - `entries` is a list of `clauses`, which are named lists.
  # - `clauses`' names are `symbols`, the values are the `ranges` of the symbols within that clause
  # - `unit`: clause with single symbol
  # Glossary of operations:
  # - `unit propagation`: ranges of a symbol within a unit constitute the entire possible range of that symbol,
  #   so all clauses with that symbol are restricted to those values
  # - `subsumption elimination`: if all ranges of all symbols within one clause are subsets of those ranges in another clause,
  #   then the other clause can be removed
  # - `self-subsumption elimination`: if the ranges of all except one symbol within one clause are a subset of those ranges
  #   in another clause, then the remaining symbol in the latter clause can be intersected with the remaining symbol.
  # - `hidden literal addition` (HLA): if the ranges of all except one symbol within one clause are a subset of those ranges
  #   in another clause, then the *complement* of the remaining symbol in the former clause can be added to the latter clause.
  #   This is basically the reverse of self-subsumption elimination. We do not use this to change clauses directly;
  #   the point here is that the resulting clause, even if applied repeatedly, is logically equivalent to the original clause within the formula:
  #   - `hidden subsumption elimination`: if applying HLA results in a clause that can be subsumed, the original clause can be removed.
  #   - `hidden tautology elimination`: if applying HLA results in a clause that is a tautology, the original clause can be removed.
  #   Note: 'Clause Elimination Procedures for CNF Formulas' by Marijn Heule et al. calls this "Asymmetric Hidden Literal Addition".
