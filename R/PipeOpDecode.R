#'
#' @description
#' Reverses one-hot or treatment encoding of columns. It collapses multiple `numeric` or `integer` columns into one `factor`
#' column based on a specified grouping pattern of column names.
#'
#' May be applied to multiple groups of columns, grouped by matching a common naming pattern. The grouping pattern is
#' extracted to form the name of the newly derived `factor` column, and levels are constructed from the previous column
#' names, with parts matching the grouping pattern removed. The level per row of the new factor column is generally
#' determined as the name of the column with the maximum value in the group.
#' For example, columns `x.1` and `x.2` might be collapsed into a new factor column `x` with levels `1` and `2`, while
#' columns `y.1` and `y.2` might be interpreted as a separate group and collapsed into a new column `y`.
#'
#' @section Construction:
#' ```
#' PipeOpEncode$new(id = "decode", param_vals = list())
#' ```
#' * `id` :: `character(1)`\cr
#'   Identifier of resulting object, default `"decode"`.
#' * `param_vals` :: named `list`\cr
#'   List of hyperparameter settings, overwriting the hyperparameter settings that would otherwise be set during construction. Default `list()`.
#'
#' @section Input and Output Channels:
#' Input and output channels are inherited from [`PipeOpTaskPreproc`].
#'
#' The output is the input [`Task`][mlr3::Task] with encoding columns collapsed into new decoded columns.
#'
#' @section State:
#' The `$state` is a named `list` with the `$state` elements inherited from [`PipeOpTaskPreproc`], as well as:
#' * `colmaps` :: named `list`\cr
#'   Named list of named character vectors. Each element is named according to the new column name extracted by
#'   `group_pattern`. Each vector contains the level names for the new factor column that should be created, named by
#'   the corresponding old column name. If `treatment_encoding` is `TRUE`, then each vector also contains `"ref"` as the
#'   reference class with an empty string as name.
#' * `treatment_encoding` :: `logical(1)`\cr
#'   Indicates whether treatment encoding (`TRUE`) or one-hot encoding (`FALSE`) is assumed.
#' * `cutoff` :: `numeric(1)`\cr
#'   The cutoff value for identifying the reference level in case of treatment encoding.
#' * `ties_method` :: `character(1)`\cr
#'   Method for resolving ties when multiple columns have the same value. Options include `"first"`, `"last"`, or `"random"`.
#'
#' @section Parameters:
#' The parameters are the parameters inherited from [`PipeOpTaskPreproc`], as well as:
#' * `group_pattern` :: `character(1)`\cr
#'   A regular expression to be applied to column names. Should contain a capturing group for the new
#'   column name, and match everything that should not be interpreted as the new factor levels (which are constructed as
#'   the difference between column names and what `group_pattern` matches).
#'   If set to `""`, all columns matching the `group_pattern` are collapsed into one factor column called
#'   `pipeop.decoded`. Use [`PipeOpRenameColumns`] to rename this column.
#'   Initialized to `"^([^.]+)\\."`, which would extract everything up to the first dot as the new column name and
#'   construct new levels as everything after the first dot.
#' * `treatment_encoding` :: `logical(1)`\cr
#'   If `TRUE`, treatment encoding is assumed instead of one-hot encoding. Initialized to `FALSE`.
#' * `treatment_cutoff` :: `numeric(1)`\cr
#'   If `treatment_encoding` is `TRUE`, specifies a cutoff value for identifying the reference level. The reference level
#'   is set to `"ref"` in rows where the value is less than or equal to a specified cutoff value (e.g., `0`) in all
#'   columns in that group To change the name of the reference level, use [`PipeOp???`] (Mutate? ColApply?).
#'   Initialized to `0`.
#' * `ties_method` :: `character(1)`\cr
#'   Method for resolving ties if multiple columns have the same value. Specifies the value from which of the columns
#'   with the same value is to be picked. Options are `"first"`, `"last"`, or `"random"`. Initialized to `"random"`.
